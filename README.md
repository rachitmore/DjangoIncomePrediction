# DjangoIncomePrediction# Income Prediction with Adult Census Data

## Description
This project involves the development and implementation of a machine learning model to predict income levels using the Adult dataset. The model achieved an impressive 87% test accuracy. Advanced preprocessing techniques were applied to engineer and transform raw data. Various powerful models, including Gradient Boosting, Xgboost, LightGB, Cat Boosting, and Hist GradientBoostingClassifier, were employed to achieve accurate predictions.
